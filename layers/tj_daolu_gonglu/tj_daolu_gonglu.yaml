      Contains administrative boundaries (no maritime boundaries yet) as linestrings.
      Until z7 [Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/)
      is used after which OSM boundaries ([`boundary=administrative`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative)) are present from z8 to z14.
      OSM data contains all [`admin_level`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
      but for most styles it makes sense to just style `admin_level=2` and `admin_level=4`.
